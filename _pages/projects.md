    • Developed Python web scrapers to automatically extract financial news from multiple platforms and label the text as Positive, Neutral, or Negative.<br>
    • Built and fine-tuned a classification network based on BERT(pre-trained model) with accuracy over 80% using Keras framwork<br>
    • Deployed a visualization website to display model classification results interactively.

    <b>10+ stars on Github</b> This notebook introduces the development and deployment process of a fitness motion recognition algorithm based on built-in smartphone sensors. The algorithm identifies the user’s current action using data collected from the smartphone’s accelerometer and gyroscope sensors. For deployment, TensorFlow Serving was used to deploy the model to a server, and a Flask web framework was used to build an API service interface, allowing WeChat mini-programs to call and return prediction results.
